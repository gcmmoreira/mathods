      <p><strong>METHODS</strong></p>

<p><strong>Individuals, markers and segregation</strong></p>

<p>To construct the genetic linkage map 418 markers genotyped in 287 individuals from a F2 population (originated by the cross among Mimulus guttatus and M. nasutus) were used. All markers were separated into Dominant and Codominants groups to perform segregation test using the Chi-square Test. Bonferroni correction were applied to counteract the problem of multiple comparisons (considered significant only those markers for which p &lt; 0.05/418). Markers that were classified as no significant were excluded from linkage groups posteriorly. </p>

<p><strong>Genetic linkage map construction</strong></p>

<p>To construct genetic linkage map, all analysis was performed using RStudio (Version 0.98.1103) and using OneMap software (Margarido et al., 2007) (as R package). </p>

<p>Two-point analyses (Wu et al., 2002) between all pairs of markers were implemented using all 418 markers and after that the estimation of recombination fraction were obtained considering the distance of 37 cM (centiMorgans). Twelve linkage groups (with LOD score equal to 6 and recombination fraction estimated before) were obtained; 411 markers were assigned into groups and 7 were unlinked markers. </p>

<p>Those markers that were no significant after Bonferroni correction were dropped from each group. In total, 349 markers were kept. To order markers into specific groups, map function applied was Kosambi (Kosambi, 1944) enables convert recombination fractions to distance in cM and RECORD algorithm (Van Os et al., 2005) were implemented. Possible alternative orders were checked by RIPPLE algorithm considering windows size of 4 and LOD score equal to 3. Plots with recombination fraction matrix and LOD score were generated for each group (available in Supplementary material) enables check the quality of mapping and ordering. </p>

<p>After graph checking, one group was analyzed again with different values of LOD score and recombination fraction. Three novel groups were assigned (represented as group three, four and five in heatplots groups - Supplementary material). A total of fourteen groups were generated cover approximately 3330 cM and, those groups were plotted using MapChart software (Voorrips, 2002).</p>
